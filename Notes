Important commands:

- 'mvn clean install' to build the project
- 'mvn spring-boot:run' to run the application
- 'java -jar target/accounts-svc-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' to run the application from the jar file

-------
To create docker image and run the application in docker container:
- 'mvn clean install' to build the project
- 'docker build -t sandeep4396/accounts-svc:latest .' to build the docker image if the Dockerfile is in the current directory. The '-t' flag is used to tag the image with a name and version (latest in this case).
- 'docker run -p 8080:8080 accounts-svc:latest' to run the application in docker container and map port 8080 of the container to port 8080 of your application, basically which we set in the application.properties file, server port.
This allows you to access the application at 'http://localhost:8080' from your browser or any API client.

You can also use 'docker run -d -p 8080:8080 accounts-svc:latest' to run the container in detached mode, which means it will run in the background. You can check the running containers using 'docker ps' command.
