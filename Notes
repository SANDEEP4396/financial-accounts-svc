Important commands:

- 'mvn clean install' to build the project
- 'mvn spring-boot:run' to run the application
- 'java -jar target/accounts-svc-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' to run the application from the jar file

-------
To create docker image and run the application in docker container:
- 'mvn clean install' to build the project
- 'docker build -t sandeep4396/accounts-svc:latest .' to build the docker image if the Dockerfile is in the current directory. The '-t' flag is used to tag the image with a name and version (latest in this case).
- 'docker run -p 8080:8080 accounts-svc:latest' to run the application in docker container and the first 8080 is the port which will be expose for the user and the second 8080 is the port on which the application is running inside the container.


PORT MAPPING
By default, containers are isolated from the host machine and other containers.
To allow communication between the container and the host machine, you need to map the ports.
The '-p' flag in the 'docker run' command is used for this purpose.
The syntax is '-p <host_port>:<container_port>'.
In this case, we are mapping port 8080 of the host machine to port 8080 of the container, which allows us to access the application running inside the container through port 8080 on the host machine.

(Where the first 8080(can be any port) is the port which will be expose for the user and the second 8080 is the port on which the application is running inside the container.)
